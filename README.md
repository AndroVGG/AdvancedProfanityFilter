# AdvancedProfanityFilter
A chrome extension to filter profanity from webpages.

### Introduction
After years of using Simple Profanity Filter, I decided that it was time to give back to the community. I hope to be able to maintain this and add some new features as well. Thanks markyd13 for all your work on this great extension!

### Installation
The best way to install this Chrome extension is to get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-profanity-filter/piajkpdbaniagacofgklljacgjhefjeh).

### Features
* HTTPS Support
* Counter for filtered words
